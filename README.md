# bodged-calamity (name is a WIP)
A pet care simulation game, similar to that of Tamagotchi. 

You've just gotten the chance to adopt your very own pet! It's your first time ever having to take care of something other than yourself, and there are so many to choose from!
They all seem a little off...

### Why?
In the past I've wanted to collaborate on an actual project that I thought would have an interesting learning curve/would make me go out of my comfort zone in terms of working in a team, having assigned tasks, and having to put these tasks together to a functioning project that we can all be proud of.

This team is driven to learn / work together to create something, and while it may not be the most polished or clean, it is about the learning experience to all of us.

## Possible Mandatory Play Features
Different starting pets will have different stats and stories
- Bigger or smaller stats bars
- Rate of growth
- ???

You will have to keep track of different stats as you care for it. Some possible being
- Health
- Happiness
- Hunger
If any of these get to 0, it's game over

There will be cutscenes with dialogue where the player has to make choices for their pet, and this will impact the end game
End goal being for the pet to have finally grown up into a happy and healthy (???)

Story elements will be revealed through either level of play / random events
So either how you care for the pet, or being randomly generated

### Stretch Goals
- Polished GUI
- Shop with cosmetics
- Achievements
- Dungeon crawling?
- Add more later
- ???

NOTE THAT THIS IS IN VERY EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND IS STILL BEING PLANNED. PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGES
