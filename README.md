# Calamity
A pet care simulation game, similar to that of Tamagotchi. Pick out a pet from an array to choose from, and slowly care for it as you watch it grow up.

### Why
Using this to:
- Get better at C# and .NET
- Get better at making GUIs/Learning how to make better GUIs
- Making better game loops
- Making a semi-polished game

## Possible Mandatory Play Features
Different starting pets will have different stats
- Bigger or smaller stats bars
- Rate of growth
- ???
- etc

You will have to keep track of different stats as you care for it. Some possible being
- Health
- Happiness
- Hunger
If any of these get to 0, it's game over

End goal being for the pet to have finally grown up into a happy and healthy (???)

Story elements will be revealed through either level of play / random events
So either how you care for the pet, or being randomly generated

### Stretch Goals
- Polished GUI
- Story with choice elements
- Add more later
- ???
