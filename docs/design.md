## Design Overview

Bodged Calamity is a game that is designed to be a pet care simulation game.
The player receives a pet, and must feed it, water it, and play with it in order to keep it alive, keep it happy, and progress the story.
Each pet has its own unique set of tasks to complete to progress the story.
These vary from pet to pet, but all pets have the same core goals.

Some of these goals include:
        <b>
            <li>Feed you pet
            <li>Pet your pet
            <li>Play with your pet
            <li>Explore a dungeon
            <li>etc...
        <b/>
